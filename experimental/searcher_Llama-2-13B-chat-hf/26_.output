[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the pandas function loc() to search for rows where the density is less than 0.8 cm3/g. We can then extract the information on the largest cavity diameters for those rows.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd

df.loc[df['density'] < 0.8, ['name', 'Largest cavity diameter (â„«)']][0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'density'[0m<class 'ValueError'> unknown format from LLM:
