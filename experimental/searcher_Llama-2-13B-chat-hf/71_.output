[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the column "Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)" to find the materials with the highest accessible surface areas. We can also use the pandas function sort_values() to sort the DataFrame by this column in ascending order.[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe have found the top 5 materials with the highest accessible surface areas. We can use this information to select materials for further study or application.[0m
[1m> Finished chain.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe names of the materials with the highest accessible surface areas are OTOLIU, ITAPIC, XIGWUF, EDECOG, and ATEYED. Their accessible surface areas are not provided in the given DataFrame.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide the accessible surface areas of the materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.

[Predictor] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mI need to gather data on the accessible surface areas of the materials and train a machine learning model to predict their values. Then, I can use the model to make predictions and compare the results.[0m
