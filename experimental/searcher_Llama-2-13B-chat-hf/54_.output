[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the pore limiting diameter of materials with a density greater than 2.5.
Action: search_csv

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the pandas function iloc to extract the rows of the DataFrame where the density is greater than 2.5. Then we can use the column names to extract the information we need.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print(df.iloc[df['Density'] > 2.5].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.csv'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mwe cannot answer the question because the file 'data.csv' does not exist.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the pore limiting diameter of materials with a density greater than 2.5. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
