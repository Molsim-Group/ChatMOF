[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the loc[] function. We can specify the column and the value we are searching for. Once we find the row, we can extract the information on the diffusivity of N2.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'IHAJIL', 'Diffusivity of N2 (cm^2/s)'].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Diffusivity of N2 (cm^2/s)'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Diffusivity of N2 (cm^2/s)' does not exist in the DataFrame, so we cannot extract the information on the diffusivity of N2 for the name 'IHAJIL'.[0m
