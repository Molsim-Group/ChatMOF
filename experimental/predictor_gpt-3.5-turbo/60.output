[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the pandas function loc[], which allows us to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. We can use the loc[] function to search for the row with the name "DUVNIS01" and then access the "Hydrogen uptake at 100bar" column to get the information.[0m
