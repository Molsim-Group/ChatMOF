[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the `loc` function in pandas. We can then access the specific columns to get the information on stability when the solvent is removed.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'JALCAD', ['name', 'Stability when solvent is removed']].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: "['Stability when solvent is removed'] not in index"[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Stability when solvent is removed' does not exist in the DataFrame, so we cannot provide information on its stability when the solvent is removed.[0m
