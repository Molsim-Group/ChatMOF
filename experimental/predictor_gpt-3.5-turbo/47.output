[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the loc[] function and provide the condition for the search. We can then extract the information on N2 uptake for the matching row.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'DUVNIS01', 'N2 uptake (mmol/g)'].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'N2 uptake (mmol/g)'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe KeyError indicates that the column 'N2 uptake (mmol/g)' does not exist in the DataFrame.[0m
