[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the loc[] function and provide the condition for the search. We can then access the specific column to get the information on the bandgap.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'DUVNIS01', 'Bandgap (eV)'].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Bandgap (eV)'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe KeyError suggests that the column 'Bandgap (eV)' does not exist in the DataFrame.[0m
