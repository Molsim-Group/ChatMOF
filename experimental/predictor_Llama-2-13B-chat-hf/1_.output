[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the highest O2 diffusivity, we need to look at the "O2 diffusivity" column. We can use the pandas function head() to extract the first 5 rows of the DataFrame, and then use the NumPy function argmax() to find the index of the row with the highest O2 diffusivity.[0m

# find the index of the row with the highest O2 diffusivity
