[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mwe can use the column "name" to search for materials with high N2 diffusivity under conditions of 298K and 1 bar pressure. We can use the pandas function loc() to search for values in a specific column.[0m

What should we do to fix this error?

Hint: think about how to convert the boolean array to a numpy array.

Please answer this question.
