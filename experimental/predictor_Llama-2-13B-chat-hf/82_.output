[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials that exhibit a high CO2 Henry coefficient at standard ambient conditions.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the 'Accessible surface area' column to filter out materials with high CO2 Henry coefficient. We can also use the 'Metal type' column to filter out materials that are not metals.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.loc[df['Accessible surface area'] > 1000, 'name'][0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Accessible surface area'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can't use the 'Accessible surface area' column to filter out materials with high CO2 Henry coefficient because it is not in the index.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the CO2 Henry coefficient of materials at standard ambient conditions. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
