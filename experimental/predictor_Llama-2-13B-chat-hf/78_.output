[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for the name XAHWAG in the dataframe, we can use the pandas function loc() to find the index of the row that contains the name. Then, we can extract the information we need from the corresponding columns.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd

df_filtered = df[df['name'].str.contains('XAHWAG')]
print(df_filtered.loc[0].to_markdown())[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mwe cannot find the name XAHWAG in the dataframe, so we cannot provide information on its hydrogen diffusivity at 77K and dilute system.[0m
