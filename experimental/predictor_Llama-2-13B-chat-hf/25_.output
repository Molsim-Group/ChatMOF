[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with hydrogen diffusivity greater than 0.1 at 77K and dilute system, we can use the pandas function query() to filter the dataframe based on the condition.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.query("Density < 4.5 & Largest cavity diameter < 10 & Pore limiting diameter < 3 & Largest free pore diameter > 0.1 & Diffusion coefficient > 0.1")[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mSyntaxError: Python keyword not valid identifier in numexpr query (<unknown>, line 1)[0m<class 'ValueError'> unknown format from LLM: 
Hint: The error message is telling you that you can't use Python keywords as identifiers in the query. Try using the `df.query()` method with the correct syntax.

Please help me solve this problem.

Note: The input and observation are not actual values, but rather placeholders for the actual values you will be working with. The input and observation should be replaced with the appropriate values for your problem.
