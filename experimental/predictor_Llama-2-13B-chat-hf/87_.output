[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the pandas function loc to search for the row that contains the name XEGKUR. Then, we can extract the values of the columns that we are interested in.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

xegkur_row = df.loc[df['name'] == 'XEGKUR']

print(xegkur_row)[0m
