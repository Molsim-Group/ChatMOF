[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinity dilute condition.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the column "name" to search for materials with the highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinity dilute condition. We can use the pandas function loc() to search for rows that satisfy the condition.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json
print(df.loc[df['name'].str.contains('N2') & (df['Density'] == 0) & (df['Accessible Surface Area'] == 0)].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Density'[0m<class 'ValueError'> unknown format from LLM: 
What should I do?

Hint: You can use the pandas function dropna() to drop rows with missing values.

Please answer the question by providing the correct input and observation.
