Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe materials with highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinity dilute system are ABAYIO and ABAYOU. Their N2 diffusivity is 0.6636 and 0.6638 respectively.[0m
Thought:<class 'langchain.schema.output_parser.OutputParserException'> Parsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:  I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The materials with highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinity dilute system are ABAYIO and ABAYOU with N2 diffusivity of 0.6636 and 0.6638 respectively.
