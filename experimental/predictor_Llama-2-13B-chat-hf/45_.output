[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo answer this question, we can use the pandas function query() to filter the data frame based on the desired criteria. We can use the columns 'Density (cm^3/g)' and 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)' to filter the materials with high O2 uptake capabilities.[0m
