[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with high thermal stability, we can use the `loc` function to select rows where the `Density (cm^3/g)` is greater than 2 g/cm^3.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.loc[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] > 2, ['name', 'Thermal stability']][0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: "['Thermal stability'] not in index"[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe have to use the `to_markdown` function to print the output.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the thermal stability of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
