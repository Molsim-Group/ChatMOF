[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific row in a DataFrame, we can use the pandas function loc(), which takes the row number or the label as an argument.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.loc[['name', 'OCUVUF']].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: "None of [Index(['name', 'OCUVUF'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe have to check if the material exist in the dataframe before searching for it.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the N2 diffusivity of OCUVUF_clean at 298K and infinite dilute condition. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
