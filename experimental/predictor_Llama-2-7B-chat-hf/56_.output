[32;1m[1;3m I need to find materials that show a high level of N2 diffusivity under conditions of 298K and 1 bar pressure.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with high N2 diffusivity, we can use the `loc` function to select rows where the value of 'Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)' is greater than 0.01 cm^3/g.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.loc[df['Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)>=0.01']].to_markdown()[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)>=0.01'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mwe have to use the `loc` function with the correct column name to select the rows where the value of 'Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)' is greater than 0.01 cm^3/g.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on materials that show a high level of N2 diffusivity under conditions of 298K and 1 bar pressure. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
