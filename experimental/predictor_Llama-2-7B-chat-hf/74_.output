[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with high bandgaps, we can use the pandas function locate(), which will return the rows that match a given condition. In this case, we want to find the rows where the bandgap is greater than 4.5.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.loc[df['Bandgap'] > 4.5].to_markdown())[0m
