[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinite dilute condition, we can use the `diff` function from the pandas library to calculate the diffusivity for each material in the dataframe, and then sort the materials by their diffusivity values.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np

[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'diff'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe need to add the 'diff' column to the dataframe before calculating the diffusivity.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe answer for question "Search for materials with highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinite dilute condition and provide their names and diffusivity values" is Cu, Co, Mn, Tb.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool provided the names of materials with the highest N2 diffusivity at 298K and infinite dilute condition, but not the diffusivity values. I need to find the diffusivity values.
