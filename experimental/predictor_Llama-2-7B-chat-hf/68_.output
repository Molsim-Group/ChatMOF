[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with the highest N2 uptake at 298K and standard pressure.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mto search for materials with highest N2 uptake, we can use the `value_counts` method to count the number of non-zero values in the 'Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)' column for each row, and then sort the dataframe by this column in descending order.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('materials.csv')
df['Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)'] = df['Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)'].apply(lambda x: x[x!= 0])
df.value_counts('Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)', axis=0, descending=True).sort_values(by='-value', ascending=False)[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe file'materials.csv' does not exist, so we cannot search for materials with highest N2 uptake at 298K and standard pressure.[0m
