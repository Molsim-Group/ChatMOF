[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with the highest N2 uptake under standard conditions.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the highest N2 uptake under standard conditions, we can use the 'Accessible Surface Area' column and the 'N2 uptake' column. We can calculate the N2 uptake for each material and then sort them in descending order.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json
df['N2 uptake'] = df['Accessible Surface Area'] * df['N2 concentration']
df = df.sort_values('N2 uptake', ascending=False)
print(df.head().to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Accessible Surface Area'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe got a KeyError when trying to access the 'Accessible Surface Area' column. This means that the column does not exist in the dataframe.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the N2 uptake of materials under standard conditions. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
