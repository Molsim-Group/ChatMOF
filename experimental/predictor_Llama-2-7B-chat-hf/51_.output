Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe adsorption capacity of N2 at standard temperature and pressure for the material with name "IZEHAX" is 4460.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool provided the adsorption capacity of N2 for IZEHAX, but not the volume of N2 that IZEHAX_clean can hold. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
