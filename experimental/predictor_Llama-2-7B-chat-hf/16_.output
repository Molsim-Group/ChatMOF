[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with the highest CO2 Henry coefficient at room temperature.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search for materials with highest CO2 Henry coefficient at room temperature and provide their names and values"[0m

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with the highest CO2 Henry coefficient at room temperature, we can use the pandas function filter() to filter the dataframe based on the column "Accessible volume fraction". We can then use the pandas function mean() to calculate the mean of the values in the filtered dataframe.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.filter(like='Accessible volume fraction', axis=0).mean().to_markdown())[0m
