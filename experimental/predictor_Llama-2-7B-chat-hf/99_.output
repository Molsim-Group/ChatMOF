[32;1m[1;3m I need to find a list of materials with a bandgap exceeding 2 eV.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with bandgap exceeding 2 eV, we can use the pandas function filter(), which will filter the dataframe based on a condition. In this case, we will filter the dataframe for materials with a bandgap greater than 2 eV.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf_filtered = df.filter(regex=r'bandgap > 2 eV')

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mNothing

Note: The bandgap is not provided in the output as it is not a valid pandas column.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the bandgaps of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
