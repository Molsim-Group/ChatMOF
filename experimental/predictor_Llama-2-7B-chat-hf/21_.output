[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with a bandgap greater than 3.0 eV, we can use the pandas filter() function.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf_bandgap = df[df['Bandgap'] > 3.0]

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe cannot use the filter() function to search for materials with a bandgap greater than 3.0 eV because the column 'Bandgap' does not exist in the dataframe.[0m
