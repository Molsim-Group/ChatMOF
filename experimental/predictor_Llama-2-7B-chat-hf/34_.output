[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mwe have to answer the question "search for materials that show solvent removal stability and provide their names" using observation.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mNone

Note: Please keep in mind that the dataframe is too large to show here, so I'll only show the first 20 rows. Also, the names of the materials are in the column "name".[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on solvent removal stability. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
