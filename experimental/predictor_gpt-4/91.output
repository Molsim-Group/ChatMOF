[32;1m[1;3mI need to find the bandgap of DUVNIS01_charged.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find a specific row in a DataFrame, we can use the loc function. However, we need to make sure that the 'name' column is the index of the DataFrame. If it's not, we need to set it as the index first. Then we can use the loc function to find the row with the name 'DUVNIS01'. However, the bandgap information is not provided in the given index. Therefore, we cannot provide the bandgap information for 'DUVNIS01'.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.set_index('name', inplace=True)
print(df.loc['DUVNIS01'].to_markdown())[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe bandgap information is not available in the DataFrame for the material 'DUVNIS01'. The DataFrame only contains information about the cavity diameter, pore diameter, density, surface area, volume fraction, pore volume, metal type, and whether it has an open metal site.[0m
