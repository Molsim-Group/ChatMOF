[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo answer this question, we need to check if there is a column in the dataframe that indicates whether a material shows solvent removal stability. If such a column exists, we can filter the dataframe based on this column to get the materials that show solvent removal stability.[0m
