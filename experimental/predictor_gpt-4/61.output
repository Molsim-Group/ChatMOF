[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the N2 adsorption capacity of IZEHAX at 298K and 1 bar, we need to check if the DataFrame has a column for N2 adsorption capacity, and if it does, we can filter the DataFrame for the row where the name is IZEHAX and the conditions are 298K and 1 bar.[0m
