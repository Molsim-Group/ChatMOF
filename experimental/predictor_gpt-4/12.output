[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the information about a specific row based on the 'name' column, we can use the loc function in pandas. We will use this function to find the row where the 'name' column is equal to 'XAVDUV'. Then, we will print the information about its hydrogen storage capacity under 100bar pressure at 77K.[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Hydrogen storage capacity under 100bar pressure at 77K' does not exist in the DataFrame. Therefore, we cannot provide information on the hydrogen storage capacity of 'XAVDUV' under 100bar pressure at 77K.[0m
