[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the stability of JALCAD at 298K and 1bar when the solvent is removed, we need to check if there is a column that contains this information. If there is, we can filter the DataFrame to find the row where the name is JALCAD and print the value in the stability column.[0m
