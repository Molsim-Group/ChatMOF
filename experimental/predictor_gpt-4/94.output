[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find a specific row in a DataFrame, we can use the loc function in pandas. In this case, we want to find the row where the name is 'DUVNIS01'. After that, we want to find the information on its O2 diffusivity at 298K and infinity dilute system.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'DUVNIS01'].to_markdown())[0m
