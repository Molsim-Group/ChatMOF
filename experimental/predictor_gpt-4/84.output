[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find a specific row in a DataFrame, we can use the loc function. However, the question does not specify the column name for 'solvent removal stability'. We need to check if such a column exists in the DataFrame.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.columns.to_list())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3m['name', 'Largest cavity diameter (â„«)', 'Pore limiting diameter (â„«)', 'Largest free pore diameter (â„«)', 'Density (cm^3/g)', 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)', 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)', 'Nonaccessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)', 'Nonaccessible surface area (m^2/g)', 'Accessible volume volume fraction', 'void fraction', 'Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g)', 'Accessible volume (cm^3/g)', 'Nonaccessible Volume (cm^3/g)', 'Metal type', 'Has open metal site', 'Type of open metal'][0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThere is no column in the DataFrame that directly relates to 'solvent removal stability'. Therefore, we cannot provide information on the solvent removal stability of DUVNIS01.[0m
