[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the largest density, we can use the `nlargest()` function in pandas. We will specify the column 'Density (cm^3/g)' and the number of materials we want to retrieve. Then, we can extract the names and densities of these materials.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mlargest_density = df.nlargest(5, 'Density (cm^3/g)')[['name', 'Density (cm^3/g)']]
print(largest_density.to_markdown())[0m

|       | name   |   Density (cm^3/g) |
|------:|:-------|-------------------:|
|  8448 | RUBLEH |            7.45566 |
|  2265 | ERANAO |            6.44423 |
|  4050 | IFEPIT |            5.18017 |
| 11478 | YEGKIG |            5.17652 |
|  5606 | LIQGAU |            4.60139 |[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe nlargest() function in pandas returns the specified number of rows with the largest values in a column. In this case, we retrieved the top 5 materials with the largest density.[0m
