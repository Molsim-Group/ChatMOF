[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with density less than 0.8, we can use boolean indexing in pandas. We can create a boolean mask by comparing the 'Density (cm^3/g)' column with 0.8. Then, we can use this mask to filter the dataframe and select the 'Largest cavity diameter (â„«)' column.[0m
