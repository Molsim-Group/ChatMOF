[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use boolean indexing. We can create a boolean mask by comparing the values in the 'name' column with the desired value. Then, we can use this mask to filter the DataFrame and extract the information on density.[0m
