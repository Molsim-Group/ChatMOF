[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with a pore limiting diameter below 2.0, we can use boolean indexing in pandas. We can create a boolean mask by comparing the values in the 'Pore limiting diameter (â„«)' column with 2.0. Then, we can use this mask to filter the dataframe and select only the rows that meet the condition.[0m
