[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use boolean indexing. We can create a boolean mask by comparing the values in the 'name' column with the desired value. Then, we can use this mask to filter the DataFrame and extract the information on the non-accessible surface area.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mmask = df['name'] == 'WAWGOQ'
filtered_df = df[mask]
print(filtered_df['Nonaccessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)'].to_markdown())[0m
