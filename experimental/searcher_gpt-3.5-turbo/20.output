[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the highest pore limiting diameter, we can use the `nlargest()` function in pandas. This function returns the n largest values in a column. We can specify the column to use and the number of values to return. In this case, we want to find the materials with the highest pore limiting diameter, so we'll use the 'Pore limiting diameter (â„«)' column and specify that we want to return only 1 value.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mhighest_pore_limiting_diameter = df['Pore limiting diameter (â„«)'].nlargest(1)
materials_with_highest_pore_limiting_diameter = df[df['Pore limiting diameter (â„«)'] == highest_pore_limiting_diameter[0]]['name'].tolist()
print(materials_with_highest_pore_limiting_diameter)[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 0[0m<class 'ValueError'> unknown format from LLM: Final Thought: It seems that there is a KeyError when trying to access the value at index 0 of the `highest_pore_limiting_diameter` series. This could be because there are no materials in the dataframe or there is an issue with the column name. We should investigate further.
