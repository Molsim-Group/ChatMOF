[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the largest accessible surface area, we can use the `nlargest()` function in pandas. We will specify the column 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)' and the number of materials we want to retrieve. Then, we can extract the names of these materials.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mlargest_surface_area = df.nlargest(5, 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)')
material_names = largest_surface_area['name']
print(material_names.to_markdown())[0m
