[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the largest cavity diameter, we can use the `idxmax()` function in pandas to get the index of the maximum value in the "Largest cavity diameter (â„«)" column. Then, we can use the index to get the corresponding material names.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mmax_cavity_diameter = df['Largest cavity diameter (â„«)'].idxmax()
materials_with_max_cavity_diameter = df.loc[max_cavity_diameter, 'name']
print(materials_with_max_cavity_diameter)[0m
