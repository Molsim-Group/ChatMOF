[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with accessible surface area above 3000 m^2/g, we can use boolean indexing in pandas. We can create a boolean condition to filter the dataframe based on the condition `df['Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)'] > 3000`. Then, we can select the 'Density (cm^3/g)' column for the filtered materials.[0m
