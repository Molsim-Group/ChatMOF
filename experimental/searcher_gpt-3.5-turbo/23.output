[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame column, we can use the pandas function loc[], which allows us to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. We can use the loc[] function to filter the DataFrame based on the 'name' column and then retrieve the 'Metal type' value for the filtered row.[0m
