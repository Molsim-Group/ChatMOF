[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the largest density, we can use the `nlargest()` function in pandas. We will specify the column `Density (cm^3/g)` and the number of materials we want to retrieve. Then, we can extract the names and densities of these materials.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mlargest_density = df.nlargest(5, 'Density (cm^3/g)')
names = largest_density['name']
densities = largest_density['Density (cm^3/g)']
print(names.to_markdown())
print(densities.to_markdown())[0m|       | name   |

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe answer for question "Find materials with largest density and provide their names and densities" is The materials with the largest densities are:
- 8448: density = 7.45566
- 2265: density = 6.44423
- 4050: density = 5.18017
- 11478: density = 5.17652
- 5606: density = 4.60139.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe search_csv tool provided the materials with the largest densities. I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The materials with the largest densities are 8448, 2265, 4050, 11478, and 5606.[0m
