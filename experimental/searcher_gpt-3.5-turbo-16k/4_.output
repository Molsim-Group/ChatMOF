[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in the "name" column, we can use the pandas function `loc` and provide the condition `df['name'] == 'ALIBUT'`. Then, we can extract the information on its accessible surface area.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3malibut_info = df.loc[df['name'] == 'ALIBUT', 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)']
print(alibut_info.to_markdown())[0m
