[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with density greater than 7.0, we can use boolean indexing in pandas. We can then extract the information on the largest cavity diameter for these materials.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdensity_greater_than_7 = df[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] > 7.0]
print(density_greater_than_7[['name', 'Largest cavity diameter (â„«)']].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3m
|      | name   |   Largest cavity diameter (â„«) |
|-----:|:-------|------------------------------:|
| 8448 | RUBLEH |                       3.59296 |[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mBased on the observation, we can see that there is one material named "RUBLEH" with a density greater than 7.0 and a largest cavity diameter of 3.59296 â„«.[0m
