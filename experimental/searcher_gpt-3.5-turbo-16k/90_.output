[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in the "name" column, we can use the pandas function loc[], which allows us to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. We can then extract the information on the pore limiting diameter for the specific material.[0m
