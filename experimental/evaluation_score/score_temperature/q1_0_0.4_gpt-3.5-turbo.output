I need to compare the density of LITDAV with the densities of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the density of the material with the name "LITDAV", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The answer for question "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.

Observation: The answer for question "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:The search_csv tool provided the density of LITDAV, but I need to compare it to the densities of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search for materials with similar density as LITDAV and provide their names and densities"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find materials with similar density as "LITDAV", we can filter the DataFrame for materials with a similar density value. We can then select the name and density columns for these materials.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[(df['Density (g/cm^3)'] >= 1.52493) & (df['Density (g/cm^3)'] <= 1.52494)][['name', 'Density (g/cm^3)']].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|    | name   |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|---:|:-------|-------------------:|
|  1 | ABAVIJ |            1.52493 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The material "ABAVIJ" has a density similar to "LITDAV".
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The material with a similar density as "LITDAV" is "ABAVIJ" with a density of 1.52493 g/cm^3.
