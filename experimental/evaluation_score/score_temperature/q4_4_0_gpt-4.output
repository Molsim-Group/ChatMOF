Observation: The predicted CO2 Henry's coefficient at 298 K for XEGKUR is -3.62769 mol/Kg·Pa. However, this is a logarithmic value. To get the original value, an exponential must be applied.
Thought:I need to convert the logarithmic value to the original value.

Action Input: "import math\nprint(math.exp(-3.62769))"
Observation: 0.026577507595890823

Thought:I have the Henry's coefficient in mol/Kg·Pa, but I need to convert it to mol/cm3Pa.
Action: unit_converter
Action Input: "Convert -3.62769 mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm3Pa"

[Unit converter] Thought: To convert the H2 uptake from mol/kg·Pa to mol/cm^3·Pa, we need to convert the mass from kilograms to cubic centimeters. This requires the knowledge of the density of the metal-organic framework.
[Unit converter] Unit: The unit to be converted from is mol/kg·Pa and the desired target unit is mol/cm^3·Pa.
[Unit converter] Equation: H2 uptake (mol/cm^3·Pa) = H2 uptake (mol/kg·Pa) * Density (kg/cm^3)
[Unit converter] Information: The additional information required for this conversion is the density of the metal-organic framework in kg/cm^3.
