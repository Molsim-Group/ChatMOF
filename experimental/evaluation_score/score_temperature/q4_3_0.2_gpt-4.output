I need to find the CO2 Henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name XEGKUR and provide information on its CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K of the material with the name "XEGKUR", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'XEGKUR']['CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: KeyError: 'CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K'
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The DataFrame does not contain a column named 'CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K', so we cannot provide the requested information.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: There is no information about the CO2 Henry coefficient at 298 K of XEGKUR.

[Predictor] Final Thought: Based on the result, answer the question using the predicted CO2 Henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The predicted CO2 Henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K is -3.62769 mol/Kg·Pa. Please note that this result is a logarithmic value. To get the original value, you need to apply an exponential.
Thought:The predictor tool provided the CO2 Henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/Kg·Pa, but I need to convert this to mol/cm3Pa. Also, the value is in logarithmic form, so I need to convert it to its original value.
Action: Python_REPL
Action Input: "import math\nprint(math.exp(-3.62769))"
Observation: 0.026577507595890823

Thought:I have converted the logarithmic value to its original value. Now I need to convert the unit from mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm3Pa.
Action: unit_converter
Action Input: "Convert 0.026577507595890823 mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm3Pa"

[Unit converter] Thought: To convert the H2 uptake from mol/kg·Pa to mol/cm^3·Pa, we need to convert the mass from kilograms to cubic centimeters. This requires the knowledge of the density of the metal-organic framework.
[Unit converter] Unit: The unit to be converted from is mol/kg·Pa and the desired target unit is mol/cm^3·Pa.
[Unit converter] Equation: H2 uptake (mol/cm^3·Pa) = H2 uptake (mol/kg·Pa) * Density (kg/cm^3)
[Unit converter] Information: The additional information required for this conversion is the density of the metal-organic framework in kg/cm^3.

Observation: The density of XEGKUR is 1.03463 g/cm^3.
Thought:I have the density of XEGKUR, but it's in g/cm^3. I need to convert this to kg/cm^3.
Action: unit_converter
Action Input: "Convert 1.03463 g/cm^3 to kg/cm^3"

> Entering new UnitConverter chain...

[Unit converter] Thought: To convert the density from g/cm^3 to kg/cm^3, we need to convert the mass unit from grams to kilograms. This can be done by using the conversion factor of 1 kg = 1000 g.
[Unit converter] Unit: The unit to be converted from is g/cm^3 and the desired target unit is kg/cm^3.
[Unit converter] Equation: Density (kg/cm^3) = Density (g/cm^3) / 1000
[Unit converter] Information: No additional information is required for this conversion. Applying the equation to the given value, we get 1.03463 g/cm^3 = 0.00103463 kg/cm^3.
