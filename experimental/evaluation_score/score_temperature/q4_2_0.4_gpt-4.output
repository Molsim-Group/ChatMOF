Thought:I now have the CO2 Henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/Kg·Pa. But I need to convert this to mol/cm3Pa.
Action: unit_converter
Action Input: "How do I convert CO2 Henry coefficient from mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm3Pa?"

> Entering new UnitConverter chain...

[Unit converter] Thought: To convert the CO2 Henry's coefficient from mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm^3Pa, we need to convert the mass unit from kilograms to cubic centimeters. This requires the knowledge of the density of the metal-organic framework.
[Unit converter] Unit: The unit to be converted from is mol/Kg·Pa and the desired target unit is mol/cm^3Pa.
[Unit converter] Equation: CO2 Henry's coefficient (mol/cm^3Pa) = CO2 Henry's coefficient (mol/Kg·Pa) * Density (Kg/cm^3)
[Unit converter] Information: The additional information required for this conversion is the density of the metal-organic framework in Kg/cm^3.
