I need to find the density of LITDAV and compare it to the average density of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the density of the material with the name "LITDAV", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is found in the DataFrame.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.

Observation: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:I have the density of LITDAV, now I need to find the average density of other materials for comparison.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Find the average density of other materials"

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the average density of all materials, we can use the mean() function on the 'Density (g/cm^3)' column of the DataFrame.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df['Density (g/cm^3)'].mean())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 1.373204051514143
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The average density of all materials in the DataFrame is approximately 1.373 g/cm^3.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The average density of all materials is approximately 1.373 g/cm^3.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The average density of all materials is approximately 1.373 g/cm^3.
Thought:I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3, which is lower than the average density of other materials (1.373 g/cm^3).
