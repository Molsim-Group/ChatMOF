I need to find the CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name XEGKUR and provide information on its CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K of the material with the name "XEGKUR", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'XEGKUR']['CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: KeyError: 'CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K'
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The DataFrame does not contain the column 'CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K', so we cannot provide the requested information.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: There is no information about the CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K of XEGKUR.

Observation: The predicted CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K is -3.62769 mol/Kg·Pa. Please note, this result is a logarithmic value. To get the original value, you need to apply an exponential.
Thought:The predictor tool provided the CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/Kg·Pa, but it's a logarithmic value. I need to convert it to the original value.
Action: Python_REPL
Action Input: "import math\nprint(math.exp(-3.62769))"
Observation: 0.026577507595890823

Thought:Now I have the CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/Kg·Pa. But the question asks for the value in mol/cm3Pa. I need to convert the unit.
Action: unit_converter
Action Input: "Convert from mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm3Pa for the value 0.026577507595890823"

> Entering new UnitConverter chain...

[Unit converter] Thought: To convert the adsorption capacity from mol/Kg·Pa to mol/cm3Pa, we need to convert the mass unit from kilograms to cubic centimeters. This requires the knowledge of the density of the metal-organic framework.
[Unit converter] Unit: The unit to be converted from is mol/Kg·Pa and the desired target unit is mol/cm3Pa.
[Unit converter] Equation: Adsorption Capacity (mol/cm3Pa) = Adsorption Capacity (mol/Kg·Pa) * Density (Kg/cm3)
[Unit converter] Information: The additional information required for this conversion is the density of the metal-organic framework in Kg/cm3.

Observation: The density of XEGKUR is 1.03463 g/cm^3.
Thought:The search_csv tool provided the density of XEGKUR, but it's in g/cm^3. I need to convert the density from g/cm^3 to Kg/cm^3.
Action: unit_converter
Action Input: "Convert from g/cm3 to Kg/cm3 for the value 1.03463"

> Entering new UnitConverter chain...

[Unit converter] Thought: To convert the density from g/cm^3 to kg/cm^3, we need to convert the mass unit from grams to kilograms. This is a straightforward conversion as the relationship between grams and kilograms is fixed.
[Unit converter] Unit: The unit to be converted from is g/cm^3 and the desired target unit is kg/cm^3.
[Unit converter] Equation: Density (kg/cm^3) = Density (g/cm^3) * 0.001
[Unit converter] Information: No additional information is needed for this conversion as the relationship between grams and kilograms is a constant (1 kg = 1000 g). Using this relationship, the conversion can be done directly.
