I need to find the density of LITDAV first.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the density of the material with the name "LITDAV", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is found in the DataFrame.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:Now I know the density of LITDAV. Next, I need to find the average density of other materials for comparison.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Provide the average density of all materials in the database"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the average density of all materials, we need to compute the mean value of the density column. We use the mean() function of pandas for that purpose.
[Table Searcher] Input: print(df['Density (g/cm^3)'].mean())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 1.373204051514143
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The average density of all materials in the DataFrame has been calculated.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The average density of all materials in the database is 1.373204051514143 g/cm^3.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The average density of all materials in the database is 1.373204051514143 g/cm^3.
Thought:I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3 which is lower than the average density of all materials in the database, which is 1.373204051514143 g/cm^3.
