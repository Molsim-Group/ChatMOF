I need to find the CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/cm3Pa.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name XEGKUR and provide information on its CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K in mol/cm3Pa"

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K in mol/cm3Pa for the material with the name "XEGKUR", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the CO2 henry coefficient column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'XEGKUR']['CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K (mol/cm3Pa)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: KeyError: 'CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K (mol/cm3Pa)'
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The DataFrame does not have a column named 'CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K (mol/cm3Pa)', so there is no information about the CO2 henry coefficient for the material named "XEGKUR".
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: There is no information about the CO2 henry coefficient at 298 K in mol/cm3Pa for the material named "XEGKUR".

[Predictor] Final Thought: Based on the result, the predicted CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/cm3Pa can be obtained.
> Finished chain.

Observation: To obtain the predicted CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K in mol/cm3Pa, you need to apply an exponential to the given value of -3.62769.
Thought:I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The CO2 henry coefficient of XEGKUR at 298 K is approximately 0.026 mol/cm3Pa.
