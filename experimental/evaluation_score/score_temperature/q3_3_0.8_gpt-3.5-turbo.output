[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the relationship between H2 uptake and accessible volume in MOFs, we need to select the columns for H2 uptake and accessible volume and then analyze their relationship, possibly by calculating correlation or plotting a graph.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[['H2 uptake (wt%)', 'Accessible volume (cm^3/g)']].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: KeyError: "['H2 uptake (wt%)'] not in index"
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The column 'H2 uptake (wt%)' does not exist in the index of the DataFrame, so there is no information about the relationship between H2 uptake and accessible volume in MOFs.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: There is no information about the relationship between H2 uptake and accessible volume in MOFs.
