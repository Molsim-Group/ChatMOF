I need to find the density of LITDAV.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search for the density of material LITDAV"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: Similar to the previous question, we need to filter the DataFrame for the name "LITDAV" and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is found in the DataFrame.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.

Observation: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:I have the density of LITDAV. Now I need to compare it with the density of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Provide the average density of materials in the database"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the average density of materials in the DataFrame, we need to select the density column and then use the mean() function.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df['Density (g/cm^3)'].mean())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 1.373204051514143
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The average density of materials in the DataFrame is approximately 1.373 g/cm^3.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The average density of materials in the database is 1.373 g/cm^3.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The average density of materials in the database is 1.373 g/cm^3.
Thought:I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3, which is lower than the average density of materials in the database, which is 1.373 g/cm^3.
