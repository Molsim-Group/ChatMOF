I need to find the density of LITDAV and then compare it with the densities of other common materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search LITDAV and provide information on its density"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the density of the material with the name "LITDAV", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is found in the DataFrame.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The density of LITDAV is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:Now that I have the density of LITDAV, I should find the densities of other common materials for comparison.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search and provide information on the densities of common materials"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: Without specific information on what materials are considered "common", it's impossible to provide their densities.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The answer for question "Search and provide information on the densities of common materials" is Nothing.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The answer for question "Search and provide information on the densities of common materials" is Nothing.
Thought:The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the densities of common materials. I should try to predict it.
Action: predictor
Action Input: "Predict the density of common materials"

> Entering new Predictor chain...

[Predictor] Thought: I need to collect datasets of common materials densities and build a machine learning model.
[Predictor] Property: density
