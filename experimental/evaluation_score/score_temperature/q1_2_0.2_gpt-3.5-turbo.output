I need to compare the density of LITDAV to the densities of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the density of the material with the name "LITDAV", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The answer for question "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
> Finished chain.

Observation: The answer for question "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:The search_csv tool provided the density of LITDAV, but I need to compare it to the densities of other materials. I need to find a way to obtain this information.
Action: predictor
Action Input: "Predict the densities of other materials and compare them to the density of LITDAV"

[Predictor] Thought: I need to gather data on the densities of different materials and train a machine learning model to predict their densities. Then, I can use the model to make predictions and compare them to the density of LITDAV.
