I need to compare the density of LITDAV to the densities of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the density of the material with the name "LITDAV", we need to filter the DataFrame for this name and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'] == 'LITDAV']['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|      |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|-----:|-------------------:|
| 5619 |            1.01002 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The density of the material named "LITDAV" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The answer for question "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.

Observation: The answer for question "Search name LITDAV and provide information on its density" is 1.01002 g/cm^3.
Thought:The search_csv tool provided the density of LITDAV, but I need to compare it to other materials. I should find the densities of other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search for the densities of other materials"

> Entering new TableSearcher chain...

[Table Searcher] Thought: To find the densities of other materials, we can filter the DataFrame for the desired materials and then select the density column.
[Table Searcher] Input: import pandas as pd
print(df[df['name'].isin(['ABAQEV', 'ABAYIO', 'ABAYOU'])]['Density (g/cm^3)'].to_markdown())
[Table Searcher] Observation: 
|    |   Density (g/cm^3) |
|---:|-------------------:|
|  2 |           0.949126 |
|  3 |           0.979267 |
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: The densities of the materials "ABAQEV", "ABAYIO", and "ABAYOU" are found in the DataFrame.
[Table Searcher] Final Answer: The densities of the materials "ABAQEV", "ABAYIO", and "ABAYOU" are 0.949126 g/cm^3 and 0.979267 g/cm^3, respectively.

Observation: The densities of the materials "ABAQEV", "ABAYIO", and "ABAYOU" are 0.949126 g/cm^3 and 0.979267 g/cm^3, respectively.
Thought:I now have the densities of LITDAV and other materials. I can compare them to see how they compare.
