[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with a density greater than 2.5, we can use the pandas function df[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] > 2.5]. This will return a DataFrame with only the rows where the density is greater than 2.5. We can then print the 'Pore limiting diameter (â„«)' column of this DataFrame.[0m
