[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the material with the highest density, we can use the pandas function max() on the 'Density (cm^3/g)' column. However, this will only give us the maximum value. To get the name of the material with this density, we need to use the idxmax() function, which returns the index of the maximum value.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mmax_density = df['Density (cm^3/g)'].max()
material_name = df['Density (cm^3/g)'].idxmax()
print(df.loc[material_name, ['name', 'Density (cm^3/g)']].to_markdown())[0m
