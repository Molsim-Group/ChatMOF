[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with a density less than 0.8, we can use the pandas function loc[] to filter the DataFrame. Then, we can use the function max() to find the one with the largest free pore diameter.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mfiltered_df = df.loc[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] < 0.8]
max_pore_diameter_material = filtered_df.loc[filtered_df['Largest free pore diameter (â„«)'].idxmax()]
print(max_pore_diameter_material.to_markdown())[0m
