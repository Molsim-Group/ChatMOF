[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the material with the highest density, we can use the pandas function max() on the 'Density (cm^3/g)' column. However, this will only give us the maximum value. To get the corresponding name, we need to use the idxmax() function which returns the index of the maximum value.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json
print(df[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] == df['Density (cm^3/g)'].max()][['name', 'Density (cm^3/g)']].to_markdown())[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe material with the highest density in the DataFrame is 'RUBLEH' with a density of 7.45566 cm^3/g.[0m
