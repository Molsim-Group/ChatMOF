[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with an accessible surface area above 3000 m2/g, we can use the pandas function df[df['column_name'] > value]. This will return a DataFrame with only the rows where the condition is true. We can then select the 'Density (cm^3/g)' column to get their densities.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json
print(df[df['Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)'] > 3000]['Density (cm^3/g)'].to_markdown())[0m<class 'ValueError'> The number of tokens has been exceeded.
