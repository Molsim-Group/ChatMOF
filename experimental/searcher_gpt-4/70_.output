[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find a specific row in a DataFrame based on a condition, we can use the loc function. In this case, we want to find the row where the name is 'TATFOL' and get the information on its accessible surface area.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'TATFOL', ['Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)', 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)']].to_markdown())[0m

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo get information on the accessible surface area of all materials, we can use the pandas function describe() on the 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)' and 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)' columns. This will provide us with descriptive statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum.[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe describe() function in pandas provides a statistical summary of the 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)' and 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)' columns. This includes the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum.[0m
