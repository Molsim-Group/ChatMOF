[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with an open metal site, we can use the pandas function loc[] to filter the DataFrame based on the 'Has open metal site' column. We can then extract the 'name' column from the filtered DataFrame.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mopen_metal_df = df.loc[df['Has open metal site'] == 'Yes']
print(open_metal_df['name'].to_markdown())[0m<class 'ValueError'> The number of tokens has been exceeded.
