[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo provide information on the pore limiting diameters of other materials, we can use the describe() function on the 'Pore limiting diameter (â„«)' column of the DataFrame. This will give us statistical information such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median (50th percentile), 75th percentile, and maximum.[0m
