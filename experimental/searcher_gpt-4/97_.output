[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find a specific row in a DataFrame based on a condition, we can use the loc function in pandas. In this case, we want to find the row where the name is 'REHVEH' and then print the accessible surface area.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'REHVEH', ['Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)', 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/g)']].to_markdown())[0m
