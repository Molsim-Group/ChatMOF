[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find a specific row in a DataFrame based on a condition, we can use the loc function. In this case, we want to find the row where the 'name' column is equal to 'YICTUZ'. Then, we want to extract the 'Nonaccessible surface area (m^2/g)' column from this row.[0m

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo calculate the average of a column in a DataFrame, we can use the mean() function. In this case, we need to calculate the mean of the 'Nonaccessible surface area (m^2/g)' column.[0m
