[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the largest free pore diameter, we can use the max() function on the 'Largest free pore diameter (â„«)' column to find the maximum value. Then, we can use boolean indexing to find the rows where the 'Largest free pore diameter (â„«)' is equal to this maximum value.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mmax_diameter = df['Largest free pore diameter (â„«)'].max()
materials_max_diameter = df[df['Largest free pore diameter (â„«)'] == max_diameter]
print(materials_max_diameter[['name', 'Largest free pore diameter (â„«)']].to_markdown())[0m
