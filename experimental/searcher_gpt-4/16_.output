[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find materials with a density less than 0.25, we can use the pandas function loc[] to filter the DataFrame. After that, we can select the 'Accessible volume volume fraction' column to get the desired information.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json
print(df.loc[df['Density (cm^3/g)'] < 0.25, 'Accessible volume volume fraction'].to_markdown())[0m
