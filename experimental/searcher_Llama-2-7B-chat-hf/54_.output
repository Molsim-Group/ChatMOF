[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the pore limiting diameter in materials with a density greater than 2.5.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the filter() function to filter the dataframe based on the density column.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.filter(df['Density'] > 2.5).head().to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Density'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe have to check the index of the dataframe to see if the column 'Density' exists. If it doesn't, we can't filter the dataframe based on that column.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the pore limiting diameter of materials with a density greater than 2.5. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
