[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the largest free pore diameter in materials with a density less than 0.8.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name of materials with density less than 0.8 and provide information on their free pore diameter"[0m

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with density less than 0.8, we can use the filter() function in pandas. We can also use the iloc() function to access the column of interest.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.filter(df['Density'] < 0.8).iloc[:, 4:9].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Density'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe error message indicates that the column 'Density' does not exist in the filtered dataframe. We need to check the index of the dataframe and make sure that the column name is correct.[0m
