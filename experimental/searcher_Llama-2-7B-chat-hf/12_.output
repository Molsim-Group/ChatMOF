[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the top 5 materials with the highest accessible surface area, we can use the `sort_values` function to sort the dataframe by the 'Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)' column in descending order, and then take the top 5 rows.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.sort_values(by='Accessible Surface Area (m^2/cm^3)', ascending=False).tail(5)[0m
