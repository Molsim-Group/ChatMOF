[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the highest non-accessible surface area, we can use the `sort_values` function to sort the dataframe by the 'Nonaccessible surface area (m^2/g)' column in descending order. Then, we can take the top 3 materials with the highest non-accessible surface area and their names and surface areas.[0m
