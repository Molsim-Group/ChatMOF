[32;1m[1;3m I need to find materials with the largest pore limiting diameter.
Action: search_csv

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the head() function to get the first N rows of the dataframe, and then use the locate() function to search for the rows that have the largest pore limiting diameter.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
import json

# Get the head of the dataframe
df_head = df.head(5)

# Locate the rows with the largest pore limiting diameter
largest_pore_limit = df_head['Pore limiting diameter (â„«)'].loc[df_head['Pore limiting diameter (â„«)'].gt(df_head['Pore limiting diameter (â„«)'].iloc[0])]

# Print the names and diameters of the materials with the largest pore limiting diameter
print(largest_pore_limit['name'])
print(largest_pore_limit['Pore limiting diameter (â„«)'])[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'name'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can't find the rows with the largest pore limiting diameter because the column 'name' is not in the head of the dataframe.[0m
[1m> Finished chain.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the pore limiting diameters of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
