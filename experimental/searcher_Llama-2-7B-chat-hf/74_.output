[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the largest non-accessible surface area, we can use the 'nonaccessible surface area' column and filter the materials based on their values.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df[df['nonaccessible surface area'] > 1000].head().to_markdown())[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mwe encountered an error while trying to filter the materials based on their non-accessible surface area. We should investigate the reason for the error and find a solution.[0m
