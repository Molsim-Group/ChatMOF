[32;1m[1;3m I need to compare the accessible surface area of REHVEH_clean with other materials.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "search for materials with higher accessible surface area than REHVEH_clean and provide their names and accessible surface areas"[0m

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the filter() function to filter the DataFrame based on a condition. In this case, we want to find materials with higher accessible surface area than REHVEH.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
df_filtered = df[df['Accessible Surface Area'] > df['Accessible Surface Area']('REHVEH')]
print(df_filtered.head().to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Accessible Surface Area'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe got a KeyError because the column name is not 'Accessible Surface Area' but 'Accessible Surface Area' with a single'(')[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the accessible surface areas of other materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
