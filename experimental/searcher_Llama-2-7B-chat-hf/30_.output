[32;1m[1;3m I need to compare the accessible volume of OSIXEU with other materials.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for materials with similar accessible volume, we can use the pandas function groupby(), which will group the data by a specific column (in this case, accessible volume). We can then use the aggregation function mean() to find the average accessible volume for each group.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.groupby('Accessible Volume (cm^3/g)')['Accessible Volume (cm^3/g)'].mean().to_markdown()[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Accessible Volume (cm^3/g)'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe got a KeyError, which means that the column name 'Accessible Volume (cm^3/g)' does not exist in the dataframe.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the accessible volumes of other materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
