[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the top 5 materials with the highest accessible surface area, we can use the pandas function sort_values() to sort the dataframe by the accessible surface area column, and then take the top 5 rows.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.sort_values(by='Accessible Surface Area', ascending=False).head(5).to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Accessible Surface Area'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe got a KeyError, so we need to add the column name to the dataframe before sorting.[0m
