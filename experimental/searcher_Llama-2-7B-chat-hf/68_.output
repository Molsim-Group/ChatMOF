[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with the highest density.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the top 5 materials with the highest density, we can use the `sort_values` function to sort the dataframe by density in descending order, and then take the top 5 rows.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
print(df.sort_values(by='Density', ascending=False).head(5).to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Density'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can't find the density column in the dataframe.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the densities of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
