[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe can use the `loc` method to select the rows of the dataframe that match a certain condition. In this case, we want to find the rows where the value in the "Density (cm^3/g)" column is highest.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.loc[df['Density (cm^3/g)] > 4000][0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mSyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal (<unknown>, line 1)[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe must use the `loc` method with a boolean array as the second argument.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the densities of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
