[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the materials with the highest pore limiting diameter.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the materials with the highest pore limiting diameter, we can use the `sort_values` function to sort the dataframe by the 'Pore limiting diameter (â„«)' column in descending order. Then, we can use the `head` function to extract the first 5 rows of the sorted dataframe.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mimport pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('materials.csv')
df = df.sort_values('Pore limiting diameter (â„«)', ascending=False).head(5)
print(df.to_markdown())[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the pore limiting diameters of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
