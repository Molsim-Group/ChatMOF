[32;1m[1;3m I need to find the top 10 materials with the highest density.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo find the top 10 materials with the highest density, we can use the pandas function sort_values() to sort the dataframe by density in descending order. Then, we can select the top 10 rows and print their names and densities.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf.sort_values(by='Density', ascending=False).tail(10)[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Density'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mWe cannot find the top 10 materials with the highest density because the column 'Density' does not exist in the dataframe.[0m

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThere are no data in database.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3m The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the densities of materials. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
