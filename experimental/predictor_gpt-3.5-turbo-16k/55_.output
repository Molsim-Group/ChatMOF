[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the pandas function `loc[]` and specify the condition we want to search for. We can then extract the information we need from the resulting row.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3msearch_result = df.loc[df['name'] == 'IHAJIL']
diffusivity = search_result['Diffusivity of N2 at 298K in a dilute system (cm^2/s)'].values[0]
print(diffusivity)[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Diffusivity of N2 at 298K in a dilute system (cm^2/s)'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Diffusivity of N2 at 298K in a dilute system (cm^2/s)' does not exist in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on the diffusivity of N2 at 298K in a dilute system for the material 'IHAJIL'.[0m
