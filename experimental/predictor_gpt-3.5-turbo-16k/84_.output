[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the `loc` function and specify the condition for the search. We can then extract the information related to the solvent removal stability for the specific material.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mduvnis01_info = df.loc[df['name'] == 'DUVNIS01', 'Solvent removal stability']
print(duvnis01_info.to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Solvent removal stability'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Solvent removal stability' does not exist in the dataframe, so we cannot provide information on it for the material 'DUVNIS01'.[0m
