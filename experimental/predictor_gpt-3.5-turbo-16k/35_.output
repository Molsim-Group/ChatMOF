[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific name in the dataframe, we can use the pandas function `loc[]` to filter the rows based on the condition. We can then extract the information on hydrogen diffusivity at 77K and in a dilute system.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mdf_qinsud = df.loc[df['name'] == 'QINSUD']
print(df_qinsud[['name', 'Hydrogen diffusivity at 77K (cm^2/s)', 'Hydrogen diffusivity in dilute system (cm^2/s)']].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: "['Hydrogen diffusivity at 77K (cm^2/s)', 'Hydrogen diffusivity in dilute system (cm^2/s)'] not in index"[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe columns 'Hydrogen diffusivity at 77K (cm^2/s)' and 'Hydrogen diffusivity in dilute system (cm^2/s)' are not present in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on QINSUD's hydrogen diffusivity at 77K and in a dilute system.[0m
