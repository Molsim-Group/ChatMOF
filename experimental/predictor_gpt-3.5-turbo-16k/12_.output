[32;1m[1;3mI need to determine if XAVDUV_clean can stably store hydrogen under the given conditions.

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the pandas function `loc[]`. We can specify the condition inside the `loc[]` function to filter the rows that match the condition. We need to find the row with the name "XAVDUV" and then extract the information on its hydrogen storage capability under 100bar pressure at 77K.[0m
