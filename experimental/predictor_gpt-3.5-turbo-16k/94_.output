[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific name in the dataframe, we can use the pandas function loc[], which allows us to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. We can then extract the information on O2 diffusivity at 298K and in an infinitely dilute system.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'DUVNIS01', ['name', 'O2 diffusivity at 298K', 'O2 diffusivity in an infinitely dilute system']].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: "['O2 diffusivity at 298K', 'O2 diffusivity in an infinitely dilute system'] not in index"[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe columns 'O2 diffusivity at 298K' and 'O2 diffusivity in an infinitely dilute system' are not present in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on these values for the material DUVNIS01.[0m
