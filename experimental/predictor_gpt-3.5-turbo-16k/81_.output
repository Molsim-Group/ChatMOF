[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the pandas function `loc[]` and provide the condition inside the brackets. We can then print the relevant information about the stability at elevated temperatures.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'JEDJUY', 'Stability at elevated temperatures'])[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Stability at elevated temperatures'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Stability at elevated temperatures' does not exist in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on the stability at elevated temperatures for the material 'JEDJUY'.[0m
