[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in the "name" column, we can use the pandas function `loc` and specify the condition `df['name'] == 'QINSUD'`. Then, we can extract the information on N2 diffusivity at 298K and dilute condition.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'QINSUD', 'N2 diffusivity at 298K and dilute condition'].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'N2 diffusivity at 298K and dilute condition'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'N2 diffusivity at 298K and dilute condition' does not exist in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on it for the material 'QINSUD'.[0m
