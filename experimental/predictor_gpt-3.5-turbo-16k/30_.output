[32;1m[1;3mI need to determine if QINSUD_clean can remove solvents stably.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name QINSUD_clean and provide information on its stability in removing solvents"[0m

[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in the "name" column, we can use the pandas function `loc` and specify the condition `df['name'] == 'QINSUD'`. Then, we can extract the information on its stability in removing solvents.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mpython
print(df.loc[df['name'] == 'QINSUD', 'Stability in removing solvents'].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Stability in removing solvents'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Stability in removing solvents' does not exist in the dataframe, so we cannot provide information on its stability in removing solvents.[0m
