[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific name in the dataframe, we can use the pandas function `loc[]` and provide the name as the index value. We can then extract the information on its diffusive handling of N2 in a dilute system at 298K by accessing the corresponding column.[0m

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Diffusive handling of N2 in a dilute system at 298K' does not exist in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on it for the material with the name 'GUCJAQ'.[0m
