[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in the "name" column, we can use the pandas function loc[], which allows us to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. We can then extract the information on hydrogen uptake at 77K and 100bar pressure from the corresponding row.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mocuvuf_info = df.loc[df['name'] == 'OCUVUF', ['name', 'Hydrogen uptake at 77K and 100bar pressure']]

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Hydrogen uptake at 77K and 100bar pressure' does not exist in the dataframe. Therefore, we cannot provide information on its hydrogen uptake at 77K and 100bar pressure.[0m
