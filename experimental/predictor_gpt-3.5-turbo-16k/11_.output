[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in a DataFrame, we can use the pandas function `loc[]` or `iloc[]` to filter the rows based on a condition. We need to find the row where the name is "LOQLIN" and then extract the information on its O2 uptake at 298K and normal pressure.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mloqlin_row = df.loc[df['name'] == 'LOQLIN']

[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'O2 uptake at 298K and normal pressure' does not exist in the dataframe. We cannot provide information on LOQLIN's O2 uptake at 298K and normal pressure.[0m
