[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe N2 uptake information for DUVNIS01 under ambient conditions of 298K and 1 bar is as follows:
- Accessible pore volume: 0.527997 cm^3/g

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe answer for question "Search name DUVNIS01 and provide information on its N2 uptake under ambient conditions of 298K and 1 bar" is Accessible pore volume (cm^3/g): 0.527997, Accessible volume (cm^3/g): 0.527997.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe search_csv tool provided the accessible pore volume and accessible volume of DUVNIS01_charged under ambient conditions, but not the N2 uptake. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
