[Table Searcher] Thought: [33;1m[1;3mTo search for a specific value in the "name" column, we can use the pandas function loc[], which allows us to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. We can then print the stability information for the specific material.[0m
[Table Searcher] Input: [33;1m[1;3mprint(df.loc[df['name'] == 'XAHWAG', 'Stability when solvent removed'].to_markdown())[0m
[Table Searcher] Observation: [33;1m[1;3mKeyError: 'Stability when solvent removed'[0m
[Table Searcher] Final Thought: [33;1m[1;3mThe column 'Stability when solvent removed' does not exist in the dataframe, so we cannot provide information on the stability of the material when the solvent is removed.[0m
